# Zephyr Stars

These projects have been "starred" multiple times by the 
members of the [Zephyr Foundation](https://zephyrtransport.org).
Stars mean different things to different people, from "this is a 
useful tool for work" to "I want to be able to find this again" 
to "my buddy made a fundraising website".  But it is expected 
that GitHub projects high on this list (i.e. starred by a large 
number of analytic transportation professionals) will tend to be 
in the first category.
