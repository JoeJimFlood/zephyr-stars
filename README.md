# Zephyr Stars

This project provides a tabulation of GitHub projects that 
have been "starred" multiple times by the members and friends of 
the [Zephyr Foundation](https://zephyrtransport.org).
Stars mean different things to different people, from "this is a 
useful tool for work" to "I want to be able to find this again" 
to "my buddy made a fundraising website".  But it is expected 
that GitHub projects high on this list (i.e. starred by a large 
number of analytic transportation professionals) will tend to be 
in the first category.  

If you are a member of Zephyr and you would like to be included
in this project, or if you would like to nominate other relevant
industry professionals to be included, please submit a *pull request*
to add names (both real names and GitHub user names, as shown)
in the `known-users.yml` file.

The tabulated list of stars is shown in the `STARS.md` file, and that
file is automatically synced to the
["stars" page on the Zephyr website](https://zephyrtransport.org/stars/)
Do not edit the `STARS.md` file directly; it is regenerated nightly based on
the GitHub activity of the known users listed in `known-users.yml`.
Feel free to peruse the `starcounter.py` script to see how we do it.
